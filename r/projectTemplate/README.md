# siteName

Webscraping and cleaning of the website www.siteName.com

The end goal is to create a single csv file (`salesData.csv`) that contains all monthly vehicle sales data over time in the United States.

## Workflow

On the very first time working on this project, clone the repository to your local machine (you shouldn't need to clone it again unless you want to restart everything from the repo).

- The starting point for every working session is to open the `siteName.Rproj` file. This will open RStudio and set the working directory to where the `siteName.Rproj` file is located.
- If you don't have any local changes that need to be pushed, make sure you hit "pull". This is to ensure that you bring in any changes made by someone else before you start working.
- Make changes to any files on your local machine.
- Once you've reached a reasonable stopping point, commit and push those changes to the main repository on GitHub.

## Folder Organization:

- All code should be in `.R` files put in the `code` folder.
- All data (raw and formatted) should be in the `data` folder.
- Folders in the `data` folder are organized by the date when the site was scraped.
